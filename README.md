# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Buliding y first app. with fetching an API and trying out some function from the react native library.

## The problem

I found a really cool tutorial about how to make it snow in the app. I follow it, it took so much longer than I thought.So all the plans I had for the project was unfortunately no time for. I hope to be able to complete my last page "decorating a Christmas tree" later.

## View it live

Will add this when I know how its done.
